      # This uses the SOC (state of charge) value from the MAX17048.
      # Take it with a grain of salt.

      # There is a sophisticated algorithm that takes into account
      # the battery's voltage, current, temperature, and more.
      # However, don't expect it to be too accurate without battery-specific calibration.
      # As the data sheet says (emphasis mine), the chip has 
      # "a preloaded ROM model that performs well for *some* batteries."
